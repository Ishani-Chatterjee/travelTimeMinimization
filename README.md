# travelTimeMinimization
Suppose a person needs to travel from a city ‘X’ to a city ‘Y’ through various road ways and can also opt for taking a flight.

The task is to predict the path which takes least time for travel.The implementation of the route choice based on the shortest travel time method can be used to guide people’s travel by selecting the space-time dependent optimal path.

The shortest path problem is a problem of finding the shortest path(in terms of weights) or route from a starting point to a final destination. 

Generally, in order to represent the shortest path problem we use graphs.

 A graph is a mathematical abstract object, which contains sets of vertices and edges. Edges connect pairs of vertices. Along the edges of a graph it is possible to walk by moving from one vertex to other vertices. 

Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between a given node (which is called the "source node") and all other nodes in a graph. This algorithm uses the weights of the edges to find the path that minimizes the total distance (weight) between the source node and all other nodes
