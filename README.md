The shortest path problem is a problem of finding the shortest 
path or route from a starting point to a final destination.

Generally, in order to represent the shortest path problem we 
use graphs. A graph is a mathematical abstract object, which 
contains sets of vertices and edges. Edges connect pairs of 
vertices. Along the edges of a graph it is possible to walk by 
moving from one vertex to other vertices.

Depending on whether or not one can walk along the edges by both sides or 
by only one side determines if the graph is a directed graph or 
an undirected graph. In addition, lengths of edges are often 
called weights, and the weights are normally used for 
calculating the shortest path from one point to another point. In 
the real world it is possible to apply the graph theory to
different types of scenarios. 

For example, in order to represent a map we can use a graph, where vertices 
represent cities and edges represent routes that connect the 
cities. If routes are one-way then the graph will be directed;
otherwise, it will be undirected. There exist different types of 
algorithms that solve the shortest path problem. However, 
only several of the most popular conventional shortest path 
algorithms along with one that uses genetic algorithm are 
going to be discussed in this paper, and they are as follows:

1. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
2. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
3. Bellman-Ford Algorithm
4. Genetic Algorithm (GA)
